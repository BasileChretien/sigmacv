/**
 * Guards the load-bearing invariant in the Dockerfile: the Playwright runtime
 * base image (`mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:vX.Y.Z-noble`) ships a Chromium build
 * pinned to a specific Playwright version. If the `playwright` npm package is
 * bumped but the base-image tag isn't (e.g. a Dependabot minor/patch bump, which
 * can't touch the Dockerfile), the npm package launches Chromium by a revision the
 * image doesn't contain → `chromium.launch()` throws "Executable doesn't exist" →
 * every PDF export 500s ("Export failed"). This drift is invisible at build/lint
 * time, so it must fail CI here instead.
